# PortFolio
My personal portfolio website built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. It showcases my projects, skills, and experience in web development, along with a downloadable resume. Designed with smooth animations, dark mode toggle, and a modern aesthetic â€” all handcrafted to reflect who I am as a developer.
